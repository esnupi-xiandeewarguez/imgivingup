            The government has provided multiple laws, programs, and organization in helping children
            who are out of school to have access to quality education. Two of the laws are the 
            Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act and the Governance of Basic Education Act of 2001.
            Both of these laws aim to provide quality education to all Filipinos because having access to
            quality education is a right of every person.

            The government also has programs such as the Alternative Learning System (ALS) and
            the Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps). The ALS program teaches basic and
            informal education for those children who are out of school due to dropping out,
            having financial problems in the family, or other reasons. It is also supposed to
            provide learning that are suitable for their current situations or standings.

            On the other hand, the 4Ps program provides some money for poor families to help with 
            financial problems. This can also help their children to go to school and get quality 
            education. This program really helps a lot of families in the Philippines because many
            children can already go to school because of this.
