<h2>About Us</h2>

<article>
    <p>
        As students of Philippine Science High School - Southern Mindanao Campus, we formed this advocacy group
        because we want to help in solving the issues in education. The problem we found is about the children's 
        access to quality education. We were inspired to make an advocacy group after knowing the amount of children 
        who are out of school.

        We believe that every person has the right to access quality education, regardless of their situation. Therefore, 
        as a group, we are trying to spread awareness about the importance of quality education and its accessibility and
        inspire people to help with this problem. Our goal is to make sure that every child has access to quality education.

    I am Xiandee Mesch A. Warguez, and I study at Philippine Science High School - Southern Mindanao Campus.
    I like to sing, play instruments like guitar and drums, and play sports, especially basketball. Despite
    the number of extracurricular activities I like to do in life, I am still an academic achiever. I feel 
    blessed to be given an opportunity by God to study here in this school because I know not everyone can 
    study here to get quality education. I've also seen a lot of children who are unable to go to school, 
    and it inspires me up until now to help contribute to the goal of SDG 4: Quality Education.
