Problems with education around the world
</a>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<article>
<p>
    According to India Today (2025), UNESCO said that around 272 million children worldwide are currently out of school. 
    This is because education is an important thing for everyone. Yet, a lot of people don’t have access to it. <br> <br>

    In the Philippines, a lot of children still can’t read or write even though they’re already grown up. 
    The Philippine Statistics Authority (2024) said that about 10.7 million Filipinos are not enrolled based on the data
    from the 2020 Census of Population and Housing. This proves that many countries, including the Philippines, are 
    struggling to get a proper education.

<h2>What is Being Done?</h2>
<article>
<p>
    The Philippines is trying to solve this issue by providing different kinds of 
    programs. Some of theese programs are the Alternative Learning System (ALS), Pantawid Pamilyang
    Pilipino Program (4Ps), and School-Based Feeding Programs. These programs help poor 
    families and to reduce the amount of hildren who can’t go to school.
