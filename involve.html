<h2>Get Involved</h2>

<p>
    Do you know that even when you are far away, you can still help children gain access
    to quality education? There are many ways you can help like donating, volunteering, 
    spreading awareness, and more. Here are some of the ways that you can help children get
    access to quality education:
</p>

<h2>Donate</h2>

<p>
    One way to help children is to donate. By donating, you provide help to those
    families who are in need of financial assistance so that they can let their children
    go to school. You can donate to organizatoins in the Philippines like ChildHope Philippines
    and Teach for the Philippines. You can also donate to organizations outside the Philippines
    like Save the Children, UNICEF, and Children International.
</p>

</ul>
</article>

<h2>Volunteer</h2>

<p>
    You can also help by volunteering to help children who are out of school by teaching,
    tutoring, or doing things that can help them. Just like the organizations I already mentioned,
    you can volunteer to be in those organizations to help the children in need of quality education.
</p>

<h2>Share</h2>

<p>By sharing and spreading information and awareness about the problems in education, 
    you can help. When you spread awareness, more people will gain information about these 
    problems and they might as well help.
